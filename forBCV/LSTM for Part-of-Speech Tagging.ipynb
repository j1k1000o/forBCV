    "The idea is to take a sentence and assign to each word a tag that has a grammatical meaning. This is called part-of-speech tagging. The categorization tries to take into account the relationship with adjacent words. In this example we are using three categories Noun (NN), Determinant (DET) and Verb (V) and be using and LSTM to get the speech tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is as follows: let our input sentence be $w_1, \\dots, w_M$, where $w_i \\in V$, our vocab.\n",
    "Also, let $T$ be our tag set, and $y_i$ the tag of word $w_i$.  Denote our prediction of the tag of word $w_i$ by $\\hat{y}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a structure prediction, model, where our output is a sequence $\\hat{y}_1, \\dots, \\hat{y}_M$, where $\\hat{y}_i \\in T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the prediction, pass an LSTM over the sentence.  Denote the hidden state at timestep $i$ as $h_i$ and assign each tag a unique index.\n",

    "$$ \\hat{y}_i = \\text{argmax}_j \\  (\\log \\text{Softmax}(Ah_i + b))_j $$\n",
    "That is, take the log softmax of the affine map of the hidden state, and the predicted tag is the tag that has the maximum value in this vector.  Note this implies immediately that the dimensionality of the target space of $A$ is $|T|$.\n",

    "tensors is important. The first axis is the sequence itself, the second\n",
    "indexes instances in the mini-batch, and the third indexes elements of\n",
    "the input. We haven't discussed mini-batching, so lets just ignore that\n",
    "and assume we will always have just 1 dimension on the second axis. If\n",

    "A word can be represented as a 1 in a binary vector whose length is the complete vocabulary. This is called a one-hot representation. The problem with this is that it becomes impractical once we have a large dictionary. But also, we are limited by this representation in the sense that we take each word as independent of its context. For this reason, there is an alternate encoding called word embedding. Words are now mapped into a high dimensional space $W: Words \\rightarrow {\\rm I\\!R}^n$ for example:\n",

    "This sounds great, the only problem is how do we choose the dimensions for the encoding? Normally this would be done by manually deciding important parameters one by one, but this is a strange process what is relevant? the meaning? the context? the grammatical position? this is where Neural Networks come in. The benefit of neural nets is that they are capable of discovering the representation on their own! \n",
